## <a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction

Patterned surfaces are known to show superior adhesive properties compared to continuos surfaces. [1] Animals such as geckos use patterned surfaces to climb. Many aritficial bio-inspired patterned adhesive surfaces have been made. We make and study arrays of millimeter-sized suction cups, inspired by the surfaces found on cephalopods for applications in soft robotics. This research was carried out at the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry & Soft Matter at Wageningen University & Research and funded by 4TU.Federation through the program 'Soft Robotics' with Grant No. 4TU-UIT-335. This repository contains all data that was collected in this project as well as the code used to analyse it. This document contains detailed information about how the data was acquired.

We use a double-negative mold to make the samples. A positive mold is made by 3D-printing (1). We cast this mold with Dragon Skin &trade; (2) to obtain a soft, negative mold. This mold is coated with fluor polymers to allow for the release of the sample from the mold later (3). We then pour Ecoflex &trade; in the mold after which we degas the liquid Ecoflex &trade; for 15 minutes to ensure no bubbles are present in our sample(4). We cure the Ecoflex &trade; at room temperature for 24 hours before peeling it from the mold to obtain our final sample (5).

The figure below shows the geometry of the suction cups.
