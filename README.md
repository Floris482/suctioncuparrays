## <a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction

Patterned surfaces are known to show superior adhesive properties compared to continuos surfaces. [1] Animals such as geckos use patterned surfaces to climb. Many aritficial bio-inspired patterned adhesive surfaces have been made. We make and study arrays of millimeter-sized suction cups, inspired by the surfaces found on cephalopods for applications in soft robotics. This research was carried out at the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry & Soft Matter at Wageningen University & Research and funded by 4TU.Federation through the program 'Soft Robotics' with Grant No. 4TU-UIT-335.
